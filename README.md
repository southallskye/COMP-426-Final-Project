# COMP-426-Final-Project

The final project is very open-ended and there are no specific requirements for what your final project does per se. There will be 100 overall points awarded as follows:

30 points: Having a front end that is interactive and event-driven
- sign in page
- list of trips
- add a new trip: city location, country, dates, what you want to do 
- 
30 points: Having a back end that serves at least two resources with a RESTful CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) API.
- date & location database
- diy events database
- get, store database and send to front end
10 points: Uses at least one 3rd party API
- Weather API
- 
10 points: Uses session-persistent state in some way.
For example, authenticating the user and then having user-specific preferences and/or data.
- Sign in and then access your trips
- 
10 points: A pleasing user experience (i.e., easy to use, good design, etc.).
 
10 points: Quality of presentation video
- The presentation video should be no more than 10 minutes long and should demonstrate your final project and describe the various components of its implementation. You should think of this as if you are presenting your work to someone who may be interested in purchasing your software. To that end, you are trying to show that the web application you built is interesting, useful, and well-constructed. We will be primarily grading based on your presentation video, so be sure that it appropriately points out or otherwise demonstrates the various aspects listed above (i.e., interactive front-end, backend RESTful API, 3rd party APIs in use, session-persistent state, design elements, etc.).


Each group will be expected to turn in their final projects as a repository with all of the code, stylesheets, images, and any other files developed as part of their project with a top-level README.md file that briefly describes their project and includes a link to a presentation video.

The official due date for the final project is 4/30 but final projects will be accepted until 5/7 with a 1 point penalty per day.
